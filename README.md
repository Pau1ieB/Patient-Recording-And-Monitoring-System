# Patient-Recording-And-Monitoring-System

A System to allow Prescribers to monitor the progress their Patient is making on new medication, for an initial 4 weeks.
This enables the Prescriber to view feedback and data from the patient on a daily (or weekly, if preferred) basis and to make clinical changes if required immediately, rather than waiting until the next appointment.
To see it in action, please visit the site: https://vpa.great-site.net/
The prescriber name is "paul", the surgery is "surgery" and the password is "1234". Please leave the Patient Reference blank.
From the Prescriber's dashboard you can assign a therapy (currently only for asthma), select the medication prescribed and register the Patient. This will give you a code (5 digits, all caps) that will allow access to the Patient's dashboard.
The Patient's dashboard allows recording of medication, indicating compliance, and may indicate progression of treatment. New slots are added daily.
On returning to the Prescriber's dashboard, you can now use the Patient's registration code to monitor their progress.

And there is a messaging system too.

And there is a SMS notification system, that is currently offline.
